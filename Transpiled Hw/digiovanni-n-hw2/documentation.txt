This is the documentation for HW2: Audio Visualizer

Regarding the two nodes: The two nodes I added were the 
trebel and bass node, using the BiquadFilterNode

Regarding the sprite classes, there are two:
-CircleVisualizer: Renders a circle using the line tool. 
the audio data dictates the radius of the circle
-LineVisualizer: Renders a line across the width of the canvas.
the audio data dictates the height of the line 

Also while not a class, the background gradient now is affected by the audio data

Regarding the app data, the data help is:
- The list of songs
- The name of songs
- The list of the colors
- The default color
- The default stroke

Overall for the aesthetic:
- I chose a simple, muted color scheme so I don't detract from the main Visualizer
- I formated the controls so that are class and seperated into their sections
- Centered everything on the screen
- Gave border to thinks for proper contrast

For functionality:
- Gave the user the power to play their own MP3's on my app
- Gave the user extensive control over the two visualizers, including:
    -Line width
    -Line Fill and stroke
    -Analyzed data
    -Giving the ability to toggle them

For the improvements to the aesthetic's and the functionality, I think I scored the 15%
