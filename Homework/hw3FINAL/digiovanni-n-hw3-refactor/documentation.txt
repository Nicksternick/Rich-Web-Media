I decided to code in Typescript

With how abhorrent my intro to web dev project was
I decided that it would be best if I just recoded
The project from the ground up, using the previous
project as a reference.

The main script is kanji-api.ts, which holds all of the
code that uses the api information to format it on the screen.
It also holds two interfaces. One to hold kanji that the user
decides to save to local storage, and another that holds all of
the details of the current kanji.There are two external files 
that act as supporting files to the kanji-api.ts. First one is 
a utils.ts file. For now it only has one function. But I plan
to add more pure functions to the module in the furue. The second
supporting file is the web-handler.ts. This handles the fetch requests
that the kanji-api.ts file does.

For bundling, I was initially going to use vite, but I couldn't get
building to work properly, so I switched over to webpacks partway through
